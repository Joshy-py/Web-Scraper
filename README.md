# Web-Scraper
This a project designed to collect Tech News & put it in a single dashboard. (Future expansions may include scraping the stock market & job listings)

# How It Works
This project makes use of BeautifulSoup, & Pandas. Using BeautifulSoup I scrape for posted headlines. I then used Pandas to clean up & store the data.

# What I Learned
This was my first time using all of the previously listed libraries, being able to combine them together to create a new project was a type of challenge I'd never undergone before.
